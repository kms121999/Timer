# Overview

Developing this app was a great instrument in familiarizing myself with the tools and nuances of app development. This project has grown my knowlege base and increased my abilities as a software engineer.

This app is designed as a tool to track time spent on different projects. It provides the tools to create, switch between, start, and stop various projects. It features a simple, one-page interface providing all the mentioned functionality.

I was inspired to create this app as a tool in tracking the amount of time I spent on different projects throughout college. It is much easier to consistently track time spent with such an application on a phone in your hand rather than on a laptop. I saw this as a great opportunity to learn about mobile development while making a tool I know I will use.
